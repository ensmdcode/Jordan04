<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p> I have learned so much in this Grade. From HTML to JavaScript, it was all very fun. I am really glad I was able to know about this, and this really made me happy. JavaScript can be confusing at times, especially when it comes to the operations and signs. But overall, it seems pretty decent to learn JavaScript, not that hard, but also not that easy. <br><br>This school year was really exciting. I've made friends along the way, and learned a lot. I'd say that this school year is one of my most favorite ones so far, as most of the events was really enjoyable. It had its highs and lows, but at the end of the day, it was a great class. Many memories was made with just this small room. This classroom, my classmates, my friends, these are all something that will be difficult to forget. <br><br> I'd also like to give my hearfelt thanks to Ms. Uminga, who has shared many happy moments with Fidelity, and has taught us a lot. Ms. Uminga also supported us throughout this school year, by lending her time to us, and letting us practice. I truly appreciate everything that she has done for us. Thank you, so much, Ms. Uminga!!</p>
